Templated Include :
 
 whole template should be region-agnostic (i.e. compatible with any AWS US region)

create 1 VPC and setup any other network resource required to enable the expected functionality of this challenge (e.g. route tables, internet gateway, nat gateway, subnets, etc.)


create 1 classic load balancer:
- should be internet-facing with â€œcrossZone" balancing activated.
- should route http traffic to web servers.
- set a proper health check

created 2 EC2 instances in private subnets located in different availabilityzones.

bastion host: create 1 instance in a public subnet, and attach it an Elastic IP.
